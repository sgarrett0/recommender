## Project Information

The Recommender Project will test your skills in manipulating files, loops, conditionals, and arrays.

The steps needed to complete the project are as follows:

1. Based on the "Movie.txt" and "User.txt" complete all of the information needed for instance 
variables, constructors, and accessors/mutators of the User and Movie Class.

2. Create arrays based on the two files, "Movies.txt" and "User.txt".
    You may need to read in the files, and turn its contents into movie or user objects before creating
    the arrays.

3. Use the Recommender Function to compare movies and users to group like movies, like users and recommend movies to users.

4. Return a String array of user names and their top three recommended movies. (We need sorting!)

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
